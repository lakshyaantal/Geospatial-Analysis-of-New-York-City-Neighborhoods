# Geospatial-Analysis-of-New-York-City-Neighborhoods
Used GeoPandas, H3 spatial indexing, and machine learning to analyze NYC
neighborhoods.
Processed spatial datasets of schools, subway entrances, bike paths, parks,
and neighborhoods, performing spatial joins, proximity analysis, and
normalization .
Implemented H3 hexagonal grid-based spatial indexing to standardize
geographic distributions and developed a composite neighborhood score for
ranking livability and accessibility.
Performed spatial transformations and calculations to derive actionable
insights and applied geospatial techniques to enhance data-driven decisionmaking
and urban planning.
